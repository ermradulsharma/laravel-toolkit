# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited. We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/ermradulsharma/laravel-toolkit).

## Pull Requests

- **PSR-12 Coding Standard** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have adequate test coverage.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

## Running Tests

```bash
composer test
```
